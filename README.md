# mrcieu.r-universe.dev

This is the repo specifying which R packages contribute to <https://mrcieu.r-universe.dev/>.

To add/remove packages please edit the *packages.json* file in this repository (<https://github.com/MRCIEU/mrcieu.r-universe.dev>). Each package requires 2 attributes `"package"` and `"url"`. The `url` must be a Git repo (it doesn't have to be on GitHub, i.e., it could be on GitLab or elsewhere; and it doesn't even have to be a package under the MRCIEU GitHub account).

(The corresponding source universe repo is at <https://github.com/r-universe/mrcieu>.)
